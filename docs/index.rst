Welcome to dbqp's documentation!
===================================

dbqp (DataBase Quality Platform) is designed to facilitate testing of MySQL-based database systems.  Its aim is to provide a pluggable system that allows one to run a variety of testing tools and to share standard helper code (server allocation and management / test result reporting / etc)
